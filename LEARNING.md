# My Approach to Learning & Engineering

As a PhD Candidate in Applied Statistics, I bridge the gap between theoretical research and production-scale machine learning. Stripe’s mission requires engineers who can master unfamiliar systems quickly—here is how I approach that challenge:

### 1. Rapid Prototype to Production
I begin by implementing new mathematical concepts in R/Python to verify statistical consistency and moment conditions. Once validated, I refactor the logic into high-performance, modular **PyTorch** code optimized for GPU/HPC scaling.

### 2. Collaborative Engineering
During my **UW Data Science for Social Good** fellowship, I was required to adopt a complex, pre-existing tech stack. By engaging in rigorous **Git-based code reviews** and pair programming, I mastered the project's data engineering standards (DBT, CI/CD) within the first 10 days of the program.

### 3. Systematic Debugging
In high-dimensional ML ($p > 10,000$), bugs are often statistical rather than syntax-based. I treat model debugging like a scientific experiment: utilizing **unit tests** to verify that my estimators remain orthogonal and that uncertainty bands are correctly calibrated across different data regimes.

### 4. Continuous Curiosity
I am a proactive learner. Whether it is mastering **Scala/Spark** for distributed data processing or staying current with **LLM Finetuning** techniques, I rely on documentation, technical papers, and a strong foundational knowledge of computer science to become a contributor on any codebase quickly.
